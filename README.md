# Machine Learning Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for the California housing dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

### Usage
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`

The `main.py` script orchestrates the entire pipeline. It preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest regressor model, evaluates the model's performance, and visualizes the results.

For detailed information about each component, refer to the source code files and their respective docstrings.
